//! Bahndaten verlässlich und schnell in die Blockchain gepuffert - **Persistente Redundante Einheit für Langzeit-Logging über Blockchain**
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! `PrellBlock` is a lightweight logging blockchain, written in `Rust`, which is designed for datastorage purposes in a railway environment.
//! By using an execute-order-validate procedure it is assured, that data will be saved, even in case of a total failure of all but one redundant processing unit.
//! While working in full capactiy, data is stored and validated under byzantine fault tolerance. This project is carried out in cooperation with **Deutsche Bahn AG**.
